I'm a software developer and live a splendid life with my wife and daughters.

In the past (2004-2014), I posted articles/pictures on multiple websites - [tumblr](https://guptachirag.tumblr.com/), [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/guptachirag/), [woikr](https://woikr.com/author/chirag/), [blogger](https://guptachirag.blogspot.com/) and [a blog about future of computing](https://futureofcomputing.blogspot.com/).
