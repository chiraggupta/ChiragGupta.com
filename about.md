I'm a software developer and live a splendid life with my wife and daughters.

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username| cgi_escape | escape }}), [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username| cgi_escape | escape }}) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username| cgi_escape | escape }}). I use [Instagram](https://instagram.com/{{ site.instagram_username| cgi_escape | escape }}) too but I rarely post there anymore.

In the past (2004-2014), I posted articles/pictures on multiple websites - [tumblr](https://guptachirag.tumblr.com/), [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/guptachirag/), [woikr](https://woikr.com/author/chirag/), [blogger](https://guptachirag.blogspot.com/) and [a blog about future of computing](https://futureofcomputing.blogspot.com/).
