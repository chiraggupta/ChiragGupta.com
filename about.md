I am a software developer, a recovering Apple fanboy and a new Zelda fan. I was born in a satellite city near Delhi, India but since then I've lived in five other cities. Presently, I live in London with my wonderful wife and daughters.

I've been programming casually since 1998 and professionally since 2007. I may even have worked on something you directly or indirectly used in the past. I work at [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net) and I've been here for over 2 years. Presently I'm focused on making our mobile website faster and easier to use.

If you prefer something less chatty, you can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username| cgi_escape | escape }}). You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username| cgi_escape | escape }}), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username| cgi_escape | escape }}) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/{{ site.instagram_username| cgi_escape | escape }}).

In the past (2004-2014), I posted articles/pictures on multiple websites - [tumblr](https://guptachirag.tumblr.com/), [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/guptachirag/), [woikr](https://woikr.com/author/chirag/), [blogger](https://guptachirag.blogspot.com/) and [a blog about future of computing](https://futureofcomputing.blogspot.com/).
