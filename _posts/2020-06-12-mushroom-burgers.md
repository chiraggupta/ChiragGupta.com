I grew up in a vegetarian household and burgers meant mince vegetable patties. I loved eating them but the flavour profile was all about the crunchy exterior and spices and that made them feel like a fried snack. After I discovered real burgers, I pretty much stopped ordering vegetarian burgers. I don't think I would hate a McVeggie or the good old McAloo Tikki, it's just that there are much better options easily available at good burger chains, independent burger restaurants and farmer's markets.

Sometime last year I was looking for what to make for Sunday dinner and stumbled upon a few veggie burger recipes that got me interested. The first attempt was a bean burger and that wasn't bad at all so I started trying out different veggie burgers recipes every Sunday. After a few trials and errors I landed onto my new favourite veggie burger recipe. It's based on [a recipe from Chef John at FoodWishes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub8F-ACkkYU) but I've tweaked the process and ingredients to my liking. These burgers are healthy, tasty and everyone at home really enjoys them so give it a try.

## Ingredients

_Makes 4 burgers_

- 400g mushrooms
- 1 large onion
- 50g mature cheddar cheese
- 3 heaped tbsp rolled oats
- 4 heaped tbsp breadcrumbs
- 1 egg
- 2 tbsp oil
- 2 cloves of garlic (or 1 tsp garlic granules)
- italian seasoning
- black pepper

#### Optional

- Burger buns
- Lettuce
- Mayonnaise
- Ketchup

## Recipe

### Get everything ready

- Dice the mushrooms into 1-2 cm pieces
- Roughly dice the onion into small pieces
- Grate the cheese (dicing works too)
- Mince the garlic

### Cook mushrooms

- Heat one tbsp of oil in a pan (large enough to fit all the mushrooms)
- Add onions, garlic, a pinch of salt and cook for 5 minutes or until they are soft and brown
- Add mushrooms and cook on medium flame. In a few minutes they will start releasing water.
- Keep cooking till all the water has dried up. This takes a long time (15+ min) but it's totally worth the wait. The burgers don't taste nearly as good if the mushrooms remain watery.
- Add salt, black pepper and italian seasoning to the cooked mushrooms. Don't forget to taste and adjust if needed.
- Transfer the mushrooms to a mixing bowl and let them cool for a couple of minutes.

### Prepare the mixture

- Add cheese, eggs and oats to the mushrooms and mix well.
- Add breadcrumbs one tablespoon at a time and mix. You are looking for a mixture that's neither too dry, nor too wet. You should be able to roll it into balls without them falling apart.
- I usually put the mixture in the freezer for 30 minutes at this time but you can skip this step if you can't wait.

### Make burgers

- Brush a pan with oil and bring it to medium heat.
- Meanwhile divide the mixture into four portions.
- Take each portion and roll it into a ball. Make sure it's fairly tight and then slightly flatten it on your palm.
- Put the burger onto the pan, press it gently and let it cook for at least 5 minutes on each side. It should be nicely browned and should not stick to the bottom before you turn it over.
- Let the burgers cool down for a couple of minutes and you are ready to serve!

### Serve

I like to serve these on brioche burger buns with lettuce, mayonnaise and a dash of ketchup. You can use any buns and condiments but remember that these are softer than regular burgers so crusty rolls may not be a great option.
