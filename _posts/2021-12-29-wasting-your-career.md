A few years ago my wife started a yearly journal where we write about our last year and set goals for the new year. Thinking about 2021 somehow led me to reflect on my whole career. I read [this article about wasting your career a year at a time](https://apoorvagovind.substack.com/p/how-to-waste-your-career-one-comfortable), again, and concluded that while it's excellent advice, the parameters I use to define a wasteful period in my career are slightly different.

If you want to reflect on your career, I suggest reading both the [original post](https://apoorvagovind.substack.com/p/how-to-waste-your-career-one-comfortable) and this one and decide what parameters are important to you.

<h3>What are the indicators?</h3>

**Growth:** What did you learn in the last six months?
Growth at work generally happens in two ways. The first is picking up skills like getting better at database optimisations, iOS animations, incidence management or doing performance reviews. These directly make you more employable and are usually listed down as requirements in job ads. The other way you grow is by gaining unique, invaluable experiences e.g. helping grow your org from 5 to 20 engineers or working on a service that scales from 100k to 5 million users. In either of these situations you would run into and solve loads of problems that will help form a mental playbook for when you run into similar situations in the future. These experiences aren't always easy to quantify but they will define your career.

**Impact:** What did you accomplish over the last six months?
There are many ways you can have impact and ideally they should be connected to your company's goals and mission. You could have direct impact like making or saving money for the company, launching their next big product or helping them grow to a new market. You could also have indirect impact such as making critical systems faster or more efficient, building the localisation system that enables multiple language support, or coaching people in your team to help them deliver to customers faster. It's likely you already do this when you do your regular self-assessment during the performance review season but if you don't, think about how you spent the majority of your time and how it contributed to your team's goals. If you don't already know this, I would highly recommend asking your manager about this.

**Culture:** Can you associate with the culture your workplace/team promotes?


**Life:** Did you dial down your career aspirations to focus on your personal life?
This doesn’t apply to everyone but there have been times where I prioritised my personal life over work. I still did my job but I wasn’t optimising for career growth.


<h3>Reflecting on my career</h3>
The whole point of this exercise was to apply this to my own career and I did. I’ve worked for roughly 14 years and here’s a rough breakup of what bits I thought were wasteful.
