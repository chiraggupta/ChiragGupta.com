A few years ago my wife started a yearly journal where we write about the last year and set goals for the new year. I was going about doing my bit for 2021 but that spiralled me into reflecting upon my whole career. I read [this excellent article about wasting your career](https://apoorvagovind.substack.com/p/how-to-waste-your-career-one-comfortable), again, and realised that while it's excellent advice, the indicators don’t exactly match my criteria of defining a wasteful period in my career. That combined with a week with nothing to do means I’m now writing a blog post after over a year!

## Indicators of a useful period of time

### 1. Growth
_What did you learn in the last six months?_

You can grow at work by picking up skills like writing good documents, getting better at database optimisations or doing performance reviews. These directly make you more employable and are usually listed down as requirements in job ads.

You could also grow by gaining unique experience e.g. helping grow your org from 5 to 20 engineers or working on a service that scales from 100k to 5 million users. In either of these situations you would face and solve problems that will help form a mental playbook for the future. These experiences aren't always easy to quantify but they will define your career.

I try not to associate growth with promotions and titles because they mean very different things in different jobs but if you have stayed in the same job for very long, you could use it as a complementary indicator.

### 2. Impact
#### What did you accomplish over the last six months?

There are many many ways you can have impact but it should be connected to your work's mission and goals. You could have direct impact like saving money for the company, shipping a product or feature or helping them grow to a new market. You could also have indirect impact such as making critical systems faster or more efficient, building the localisation system that enables multiple language support, or coaching people in your team to help them deliver faster.

Many of you would already be familiar with writing down your impact over the last six months for performance reviews, but if you don't do those think about how you spent the majority of your time and how that contributed to your team's goals. If you are struggling to connect your work with the impact it had or will have, I would highly recommend talking to your line manager about this. Understanding your work’s impact is essential to having a purposeful career.


### 3. Culture
##### Did you find it easy to fit in and belong or were you passionate about the mission?

This is the hardest one to define but irrespective of your opinions about organisational culture, you can’t deny that everyone holds some baseline expectations for their teams and companies. For some, if they believe in the company's values and mission, they are willing to tolerate any kind of team and colleagues. For others, the team they interact with day to day is the most important but they don’t care so much about what the company stands for or promotes. You may belong to one of these categories or others but it’s important to define what’s important to you and if you got that in your job in the last six months.


### 4. Life
###### Were you able to balance your work with what's important in your personal life?

There have been times where I prioritised my personal life over work. I still did my job but I wasn’t really optimising for career growth. It’s good to acknowledge this as an indicator because you may want to prioritise it higher or lower in different phases of your life.

<!-- <TODO>While it’s mostly  -->

## Are these indicators equally important?
  
I started with equal weights and realised that I’ve always optimised my career for growth and not reflecting that doesn’t show the real picture. I’ve often changed jobs and teams because I was passionate about an industry or technology. This often reduced the impact I could have had but got me invaluable experience and I wouldn’t want to go back and change the decision.

I set the weight for growth as 40%, and impact, culture and life at 20% each. Anything below 50 marks a wasteful period in the career and staying above 75 is optimal.

The weights also lead to interesting combinations and I'll try to give a few examples of the scenarios.
#### Impact + Culture
You love the mission and put ridiculous hours at work but you stay within your area of expertise and don’t look for opportunities to grow. You often feel you are doing great but this is toil and can often cause burnout.

#### Culture + Life

You love working with your team and the job allows you to balance your work and personal life. But you aren’t learning or having any meaningful impact. These jobs/teams are often the hardest to quit but if you want to have a purposeful, rewarding career you need to identify these and move on.

#### Growth + Impact/Culture/Life

You can have short stints in your career where you focus on growth and ignore a couple of other parameters. I said short stint because it’s very likely that the focus on growth will help increase your impact, allow you to make more time for your personal life or at least make it easier to find a new job that’s a better cultural fit.

## Reflecting on my career
The whole point of this exercise was to apply this to my own career and after spending all the time identifying these indicators and did do that. I was obviously disappointed to see that I wasted over 4 years of my career but all the retrospection was totally worth it and I was pleased to see an overall upwards trend. I can’t wait to utilise this to help others in their careers.

The period that really stood out to me was the first 4.5 years of my career. I went straight from university to a large software company, learned a lot but also got really comfortable with my team and role. I stayed in a bubble where most of my friends worked at the same place and it made it really hard to see what I was missing out. It doesn’t help that when I eventually switched I landed somewhere that paid a lot better but ended up being much worse for my career. Until I switched jobs yet again, I had little idea of what a rewarding and high growth job looks like. This is why I really appreciate folks who have worked hard to build all the software career communities that make it easy to see what you might be missing.

I could go into a lot more detail but that’s probably best left for a future post. Go and spend some time reflecting on your own career, I promise it’s worth the effort!
