I used to blog regularly back in the day when RSS was popular and Google Reader was a thing. I blogged for almost a decade on various platforms before giving up to the ease and brevity of Twitter.

Over last few weeks, I've had multiple moments where I felt like writing but Twitter just didn't seem like the right place and. I want to write longer than 280 characters but I certainly don't want to get tied using something like Medium. I did that all this time and have ended up with my old articles spread across four different websites.

I can't be bothered to write my own right now so I looked for popular blogging markdown based blogging platforms and Jekyll and Hugo seemeed interesting. I ended up choosing Jekyll because it's a tad simpler and the default theme (Minima) is very lean and customisable. I've inlined the theme and tweaked it to my liking and will continue doing so. It's on GitHub so feel free to take a look. The blog is currently hosted on Netlify - it's hasslefree, costs nothing and that's where my static homepage was already hosted.

Anyway, that's enough talk about blogging. Hello again!
